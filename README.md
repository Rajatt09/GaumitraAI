# GaumitraAI – A Smart Guardian for Indian Cow Conservation

## One-liner
An AI-powered multilingual platform that empowers farmers with personalized breeding guidance, indigenous cow tracking, and monetization tools using image recognition, Gemini AI, and cloud-backed analytics — fully buildable on Google IDX.

## Problem It Solves
- Rapid decline of indigenous cow breeds due to lack of tracking and support
- Poor breeding program awareness and management in rural areas
- Unmonetized byproducts (cow dung, urine) and neglect of organic alternatives
- Language barriers and lack of real-time assistance for farmers

## Core Features
### AI Cow Breed Identifier
- Farmers click a photo of a cow using their phones
- Gemini Vision API detects the breed, checks for purity traits, and recommends ideal breeding partners nearby
- Trains on a curated dataset of Indian breeds (Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, etc.)

### Cow Health & Productivity Tracker
- Input milk yield, fodder intake, dung/urine data
- Gemini model predicts health issues early and suggests diet/treatment using Ayurvedic methods
- Works offline & syncs data later

### Smart Breeding & Genetic Matching
- Google Maps + AI for locating nearest genetically diverse mates of the same breed
- Suggests optimal breeding pairs to reduce inbreeding and boost quality

### Gaumitra Bazaar
- A micro-marketplace to sell cow dung, urine, ghee, or compost
- Auto-generates product labels, pricing suggestions, and WhatsApp business catalogs using Gemini

### Voice-Driven Awareness Bot (BhashaMitra)
- Built using Gemini Pro + Google TTS/STT APIs
- Educates users in regional languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, etc.) on cow care, government schemes, and organic farming tips

### Cow Census & Breed Conservation Map
- Open map visualizing cow density, breed concentration, and rare-breed clusters using Firebase + Maps SDK
- Helps NGOs and govt prioritize intervention zones
